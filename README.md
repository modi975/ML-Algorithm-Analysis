# ML-Algorithm-Analysis
This project is developed for Machine Learning problems. I mean, initially started it for my own use but after some effort it started looking good. So thought why not share it, maybe it will be useful here.  So below is brief description on its features or steps: • Select Report File : User can select/ upload report that they want to analyze. • Describe Date : Gives user option to view basic data features( mean/ standard dev/ count etc.). Can add data correlation details, plus few graphs here.. • Select Problem : Choose Regression or classification as problem, This needs to be done as algorithms available for both are different. • Regression: for quantitative analysis, ex: prices, inventory etc. • Classification: for class analysis, ex: pass/ fail, groups etc. • Neural Networks • Select Features: This will be your independent variable set, more like inputs based on which you want to analyze your data. • Select Label: This will be Target variable, value that you want to predict. • Select Model: So for both Regression and Classification, different model/ algorithm option will be available. Below options are available for now • Regression: Linear Regression/ Support Vector Machine/ Decision Tree/ Random Forest • Classification: Logistic Regression/ K-Nearest Neighbor/ Naive Bayes/ XGBoost/ Random Forest/ LightGBM For each algorithm different set of Parameters are available that one can modify, and check model accuracy results. Based on accuracy results, you can chose best Model to solve your problem • Upload Input: Upload input data that you want to predict. So here we are using historical data to finalize best solution for future predication. • Download Results: Download results. • Download Notes: User can download analysis notes.
